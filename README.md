# Lite Youtube
## Joomla 4 Lite Youtube Field Plugin

### Description
> Renders faster than a sneeze.
Provide videos with a supercharged focus on visual performance. This custom element renders just like the real thing but approximately 224Ã— faster.

This field uses the [lite-youtube-embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed) script from Paul Irish. Use of this facade script is [recommended](https://web.dev/third-party-facades/#recommended-facades) by Google for speed and performance reasons.

> A facade is a static element which looks similar to the actual embedded third-party, but is not functional and therefore much less taxing on the page load.
